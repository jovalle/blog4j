Welcome to my recap of this year's Kubernetes Convention in Salt Lake City! I had the privilege of attending not only
the main KubeCon event but also several satellite conferences that showcased the vibrant Cloud Native community. Here's
a day-by-day breakdown of my experiences, insights, and highlights.

## Day 0: Arrival in Salt Lake City (Saturday)

The Journey Begins. We're outside!

Bright and early I head to JFK and 4 short hours later find myself in Salt Lake City! Never been to Utah, or any western
state outside of California and Texas, so I had high (pun-intended) expectations. The mountain views as we touched down
were stunning!

Fun fact: SLC sits 4,200ft above sea level. I did not notice the altitude change though someone in the group did and was
out of commission for the first day as they adjusted.

I certainly knew I was in the right place seeing fellow passengers with, sometimes not so, subtle Kubernetes adornments.
