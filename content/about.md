## Hobbies

### Homelab

![12u open-air rack](/images/technis-rack.JPG)

Running all sorts of hardware and software with a focus on [Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/jovalle/technis)
for consistency, reusability, and version control.

The rack features a slab of bamboo cut and affixed atop to match the aesthetic of the office. At times I dream of a closed-air rack with ample ventilation and noise reduction. 🤑

### Guitar

I dabble in covers of random songs recreated by ear. Still can't memorize a chord by name for my life.

### Sim Racing
